        <h3>Inspiration Behind the Project</h3>
        <p>
          As an automobile dealer deeply immersed in the world of cars, I've encountered the persistent challenge
          of finding reliable and efficient mechanics. Too often, getting a skilled professional to address specific
	  car issues becomes a time-consuming and uncertain process.
        </p>
	<p>
	  AutoMech Locator was born out of a genuine need within my professional network. Countless calls to friends and
	  family in the same business revealed a shared struggle: finding trustworthy mechanics who could swiftly and
	  effectively handle diverse car problems. It wasn't just a business challenge; our clients faced similar issues,
	  leading to delays and frustrations in resolving their vehicle maintenance needs.
	</p>
        <p>
          This project, conceived as part of my portfolio for the Alx Full Stack program, aims to address this
          industry-wide challenge. What started as a web app for the end of the foundation section has grown
          into AutoMech Locator, a solution designed to streamline the process of connecting car owners with
          trustworthy mechanics.
